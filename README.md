A passionate full stack developer.
----------------------------------

As a B.tech graduate in Information Technology from Guru Jambheshwar University, I have a strong foundation in web development, software engineering, and data structures. I am passionate about creating innovative and user-friendly solutions that can solve real-world problems and enhance user experience. I have demonstrated my skills and competencies as a Software Development Engineer at Kalam Solutions, where I worked on various technology projects using the MERN stack. I supported the design, development, testing, and roll-out of web applications, APIs, and databases, using TypeScript, Workday, and other tools. I also collaborated with cross-functional teams, clients, and stakeholders, ensuring high-quality deliverables and customer satisfaction. Additionally, I gained valuable experience as a Program Management Intern at Starweaver, where I managed the daily scheduling of live classes, on-air courses, and website updates using WordPress.
